# Final Report

## Video

{% include youtube.html id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" %}

### Images

## TODOs:
At the bare minimum, the page must have:

- [ ] A video of the final product

>The video must demonstrate your project’s key functionality.
>The video must be 5 minutes or less.
>Ensure your video link is accessible to the teaching team. Unlisted YouTube videos or Google Drive uploads with SEAS account access work well.
>Points will be removed if the audio quality is poor - say, if you filmed your video in a noisy electrical engineering lab.

- [ ] Images of the final product
        Include photos of your device from a few angles.
        If you have a casework, show the exterior and interior (where the good EE bits are!)

SRS Validation

- [ ] Based on your quantified system performance, comment on how you achieved or fell short of your expected software requirements.
- [ ] Validate at least two software requirements, showing how you tested and your proof of work (videos, images, logic analyzer/oscilloscope captures, etc.).

HRS Validation

- [ ] Based on your quantified system performance, comment on how you achieved or fell short of your expected hardware requirements.
- [ ] Validate at least two software requirements, showing how you tested and your proof of work (videos, images, logic analyzer/oscilloscope captures, etc.).

Conclusion

Reflect on your project. Some questions to address:

- [ ] What did you learn from it?

- [ ] What accomplishments are you proud of?
- [ ] What did you learn/gain from this experience?
- [ ] Did you have to change your approach?
- [ ] What could have been done differently?
